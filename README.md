# About this Project

This is the first big Python project I have taken unto myself to learn programming.

### Insperation of this project:
I had alot of Duplicated Pictures on my computer so if I wanted to find and delete all the duplicated files with different names and in differnet places
it would definitly take a long time. So I thought I know how to code in Python programming language why not create a program that does this for me automatically while I do other things.

### What this program does:
It can take two inputs: One required and one optional, The first input is the absolute path to the folder / Directory of where you want to search for duplicated files; (Optional) second input is the destination so that the program knows where to move all the duplicated files so you can do what ever you
want with them most likely Just deleting them.
If the (Optional) second input is Empty the program will create a "Duplicates" Directory/Folder in the same Folder it is searching in.

### State of the project:
Completed.
