# About this Project

This is the first big Python project I have taken unto myself to learn programming.

### Goal of this project:
Creating a Free to use Duplication Scanning application and Learning from the challenges of this project I faced.

### What this program does:
It can take two inputs: One required and one optional, The first input is the absolute path to the folder / Directory of where you want to search for duplicated files; (Optional) second input is the destination so that the program knows where to move all the duplicated files so you can do what ever you
want with them most likely Just deleting them.
If the (Optional) second input is Empty the program will create a "Duplicates" Directory/Folder in the same Folder it is searching in.

### State of the project:
Complete

### Features
- Searching for Duplicates in a folder excluding Sub-directories
- Undo to move all files back to original Directory
- Cancel during action

### Plans for future
- May add more features later in the future
- Currently would like to create another project and learn more about programming
